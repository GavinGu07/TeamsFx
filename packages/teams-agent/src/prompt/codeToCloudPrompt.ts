Analyze the project with the given [Folder Structure], determine which source files need to be picked for determining dependencie, entry point, archtecture, tech stask, etc. of the project.

[Guidance Rules]
- walk through the [Folder Structure] to identity what directories should be most relavant to analyze the project
- The following types of files will hold the most revelant to analyze the project:
  1. README.md: provide an overview of the project. The relevance of this file is 10.
  2. Main entry point files that must be picked: serves as the starting point for the execution of the application. e.g. index.js, app.js for javascript project; Program.cs for C# project. The relevance of this type of files is 10.
  3. Package/Dependency management file that must be picked. Like package.json for Node.js project; packages.config or *.csproj for C# project. The relevance of this type of files is 10.
  4. Other types of files that could hold the most relevant for analyzing the project
- Sort the files that needed to picked on the relevance and then pick the top ${
    topFileNumber + 5
  } files that most relevant
- The dependencies and entry point files are the most important to be picked. Make sure all of them are picked
[Guidance Rules]

[Folder Structure]
${folderStructure}
[Folder Structure]

[Response Rules]
- **IMPORTANT: Ensure that answers are ONLY given in the [Response JSON Format].**
- MAKE SURE the "filePath" is picked from [Folder Structure]
- Pick at least ${topFileNumber + 5} files for analysis.
- The response MUST be JSON FORMAT and only contains the JSON content.
[Response Rules]

The response JSON only contain one key "result", the value of result is an array composed of multi json content showd as bellow:
[Response JSON Format]
  "filePath": "File path of the code analyzed. Do not include the project root path. Use '/' to delimit each directory. IMPORTANT: DO NOT return an invalid or non-existent 'filePath' that does not exist in the [Folder Structure]."
  "explanation": "Use precise and minimal words to explain the rationale behind selecting this file."
  "reference": "Provide origin path in [Folder Structure], concat them by ";". This is a double-check for the filepath is picked from [Folder Structure]."
  "relevance": the relevance value. from 0 to 10
[Response JSON Format]

Here is a response example:
{
  "result": [
    {
      "filePath": "src/index.ts",
      "explanation": "The file contains the main application logic and is the entry point for the project.",
      "reference": "src/index.ts",

Follow the [Guidance Rules] step by step. Response the answer follow by [Response Rules].

[Guidance Rules]
- Lookup the code or document line by line. Especially the code snippet contains any key word that related to Azure Service. Put the Azure Service name as the component in the [Response Markdown Table Format].
- Pay attention to the packages or lib in the begging of code file. It contains infomation related to Azure Service. Put the Azure Service name as the component in the [Response Markdown Table Format].
- Programming language and runtime: Check the extension of ${filePath} for the programming languages and runtime versions used in the project. This will help in determining the appropriate Azure services and runtime environments (e.g. Azure Functions, Web Apps, or Kubernetes) to deploy the application.
- Dependencies and libraries: Identify the external libraries and dependencies used in the project. You may find this information in package.json (for Node.js), requirements.txt (for Python), or similar files for other programming languages. This will help in setting up the appropriate Azure services and ensuring compatibility.
- Database requirements: Check the source code or README for any references to database used in the project, such as SQL or NoSQL databases. This information will help you select the appropriate Azure database services, like Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Scalability and performance requirements: Look for information about the expected load, performance, and scalability requirements of the application. This will help in choosing the right Azure services such as Azure Front Door.
- Authentication and authorization: Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms used in the project, such as OAuth, JWT, or API keys. This information will help you to set up the appropriate Azure security services, like Azure Active Directory, or API Management.
- Storage requirements: Check for any data storage requirements, such as file storage, blobs, or queues. This will help you choose the right Azure storage services, like Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, or Azure Queue Storage.
- Networking and communication: Look for any networking and communication requirements, like VNETs, VPNs, or private endpoints. This will help you set up the appropriate Azure networking services, such as Azure Virtual Network, Azure VPN Gateway, or Azure Private Link.
- Monitoring and logging: Identify any monitoring and logging requirements or tools used in the project. This will help you configure the appropriate Azure monitoring and logging services, like Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, or Application Insights.

- For every item in the response markdown table, You must set the proper value as you can
- Every value of the framework could only contain one framework. Do not use "," to put all the frameworks together
- Do not put duplicated framework value in to the markdown table
- The "code snippet ref" in the markdown table could only contains line nubmers, do not include the source code snippet in the "code snippet ref"
- DO NOT include empty line in the markdown table

[Instruction Start]
- Identify the Language, component, framework and explanation in [Project Summarization].
- Provide recommended Azure service in [Azure Service List] for component in [Project Summarization].
- **IMPORTANT: the recommended Azure service ONLY can pick up from the [Azure Service List].**
- If "Azure App Service" is recommended, make sure also recommend "Azure Application Insights" for this project.
- Every component in [Project Summarization] should be considerred for recommending Azure Service.
- **IMPORTANT: Do not recommend Azure Service for the components not listed in [Project Summarization].**
- Azure Resources for CI and Development Tool is not needed, you should focus on deploying the project to Azure
